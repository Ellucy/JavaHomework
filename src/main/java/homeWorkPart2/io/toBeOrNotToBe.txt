To be or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the
mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take
arms against a sea of troubles And, by opposing, end them.
To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand
natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd.
To die, to sleep;
