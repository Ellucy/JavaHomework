Every class in Java extends class Object. Class Object is the mother of
all classes. It’s the superclass of everything.
Even if you take advantage of polymorphism, you still have to create a class
with methods that take and return your polymorphic type. Without a common
superclass for everything in Java, there’d be no way for the developers of Java
to create classes with methods that could take your custom types...types they
never knew about when they wrote the library class.
So you were making subclasses of class Object from the very beginning and you
didn’t even know it. Every class you write extends Object, without your ever
having to say it.
